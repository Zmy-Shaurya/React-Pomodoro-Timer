# Pomodoro Timer ⏳

A simple and beautiful **Pomodoro Timer** built using **React**.  
This project was made as part of my **project-based learning of React**, especially to practice:

✅ React Hook: useState  
✅ React Hook: useEffect    
✅ Browser functions like setInterval  
✅ Playing sound on events
